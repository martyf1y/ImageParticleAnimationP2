The bird images do not belong to me and are just for test purposes.

What it does
- Create promise to locate images in the animation class or images folder of app
- If useable images create animation object with images array
- else return error message and do not make animation
- Go through each image with particle array of rectangles that changes every interval

Still to do

- Have pixels begin from center
- Give a target area for pixel to go
- Create a type of elastic style movement
- Have pixel lerp colour
- Create pixel complete check and when done stay for half a second

- Next round
  - Give pixels new destination and colour
  - If there are not enough pixels create more from center
  - If there are too many have them go to random empty spot and disappear
