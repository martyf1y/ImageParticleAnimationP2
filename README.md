The images do not belong to me and are just for test purposes.

What it does
- Creates animation object
- Locate images in the animation DOM class or images folder of app
- Load images and put in animation.
- Auto start animation
- Go through each image with particle array of rectangles (customisable with sliders)
- Does not create particles for no alpha pixels
- Have pixels begin from center
- Give a target area for pixel to go to
- Create a type of elastic style movement
- Create pixel complete check and when done stay for half a second
- Transition from one animation to next
- Give pixels new destination and colour
- Pixels lerp colour
- If there are not enough pixels create more from center
- If there are too many have them go to random empty spot and disappear
- When there is no more images either loop through or disappear pixels to end animation
